# University Project: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using Evolutionary Algorithms
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in optimization, where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the origin.This project applies evolutionary algorithms (genetic algorithms) to explore possible solutions and improve them iteratively, leveraging the principles of natural evolution.

This solver aims to provide an efficient approach to TSP by mimicking processes like mutation, crossover, and selection in nature.
