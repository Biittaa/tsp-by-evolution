# University Project: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using Evolutionary Algorithms
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in optimization, where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the origin.This project applies evolutionary algorithms (genetic algorithms) to explore possible solutions and improve them iteratively, leveraging the principles of natural evolution.

This solver aims to provide an efficient approach to TSP by mimicking processes like mutation, crossover, and selection in nature.

# Setup
Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Required library:
  ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib 
Clone the repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Biittaa/tsp-by-evolution.git
  ```
Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can run the main algorithm.

Run the main script:
